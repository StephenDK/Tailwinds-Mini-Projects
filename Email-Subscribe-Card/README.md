Email Subscribe Card

This project is a responsive email subscription card built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. It features a simple interface with an image, a heading, a description, an email input field, and a subscribe button. The layout adapts to mobile and desktop screens using Tailwind's responsive design utilities.

Project Structure

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the email subscription card.

css/style.css: The CSS file generated by Tailwind CSS for styling the card.

images/image.jpg: A placeholder image displayed alongside the subscription form.

screenshots/: Folder containing screenshots of the mobile and desktop views (to be added).

Features

Responsive Design: The card adjusts its layout for mobile and desktop views using Tailwind CSS flexbox utilities.

Interactive Elements: The image scales on hover, and the subscribe button changes color on hover with smooth transitions.

Accessible Styling: Uses semantic HTML and clear text for accessibility.

Screenshots

Below are the mobile and desktop views of the email subscription card:

Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher) and npm installed on your machine.

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the project folder:

cd Email-Subscribe-Card

Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies (e.g., Tailwind CSS) using npm:

npm i

Build the Project
Run the watch script to compile Tailwind CSS and watch for changes:

npm run watch

This generates the css/style.css file from your Tailwind configuration.

Run the Project
Open the index.html file in a web browser. You can do this by:

Double-clicking index.html in your file explorer, or

Using a local development server for a better experience:

npm install -g live-server
live-server

This will open the project in your default browser at http://localhost:8080.

Usage

Open the project in a browser to view the email subscription card.

The card displays an image (replace images/image.jpg with your own image) and a form to enter an email address.

On mobile devices, the layout stacks vertically; on desktop, the image and form are side by side.

Hover over the image for a scaling effect, or hover over the subscribe button for a color transition.

Adding Screenshots to the README

To include screenshots of the mobile and desktop views in this README:

Capture Screenshots:

Mobile View: Open index.html in a browser, use the browser’s developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to set the viewport to a mobile size (e.g., 375x667 for iPhone). Take a screenshot and save it as screenshots/mobile-view.png.

Desktop View: Open index.html in a browser at a standard desktop resolution (e.g., 1440x900). Take a screenshot and save it as screenshots/desktop-view.png.

Ensure the screenshots/ folder exists in the project root, and place the images there.

Verify Markdown Links:

The README already includes Markdown image links: ![Mobile View](./screenshots/mobile-view.png) and ![Desktop View](./screenshots/desktop-view.png).

These links assume the images are in the screenshots/ folder relative to the README. If you use different file names or paths, update the Markdown accordingly.

Commit and Push:

Add the screenshots to your repository:

git add screenshots/
git commit -m "Added mobile and desktop view screenshots"
git push origin main

GitHub will render the images in the README when viewed in the repository.

Notes

Image Placeholder: Replace images/image.jpg with an actual image file in the images/ directory, or update the src attribute in index.html to point to a valid image URL.

Customization: Modify the Tailwind classes in index.html or update css/style.css to adjust styling (e.g., colors, fonts).

Form Functionality: The current code includes a static form. To make the subscribe button functional, you’ll need to add JavaScript and a backend service (e.g., for handling email subscriptions).

Troubleshooting

Styles Not Applied: Ensure npm run watch is running to generate css/style.css. Verify that css/style.css is correctly linked in index.html.

Image Not Found: Check that the images/image.jpg file exists or update the src attribute in index.html.

Screenshots Not Displaying: Ensure the screenshot files are in the screenshots/ folder and the Markdown paths in the README are correct.

Responsive Issues: Test the page in different screen sizes to ensure Tailwind’s responsive classes (md:) work as expected.
